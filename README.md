# PipeLoss

## Status
The GUI has been completed and is working the.  Debugging is underway to
address errors regarding input.

## To Do
Finalize debugging and the user manual.

## Scope
When completed the project will be a GUI for the solution to:
Steady Flow Analysis of Pipe Networks: An Instructional Manual by Roland W. Jeppson.
In addition to network piping it will be able to solve single line systems for slurries
and vapours.  The code will be derived from Jeppson's technical paper, Crane 410 technical paper and
both the Wier and Warman pump handbooks, for slurry calculations.

## Structure
The GUI has been built using wxpython, Reportlab for reporting, SQLite for data storage
and matplot for input graphics.  The writer does not profess to be a computer programming
of any great skill, but has endevored to use best practices.
