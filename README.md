# PipeLoss

##Status
Present stage of the project is the completion of the GUI interface and some offline
programming for the solution of network and single line piping.

##To Do
Incorporate the actual coding to solve the flow and head loss calculations, followed
with the final debugging.

##Scope
When completed the project will be a GUI for the solution to:
Steady Flow Analysis of Pipe Networks: An Instructional Manual by Roland W. Jeppson.
In addition to network piping it will be able to solve single line systems for slurries
and vapours.  The code will from Jeppson's technical, the Crane 410 technical paper and
both the Wier and Warman pump handbooks, for slurry caluculations.

##Structure
The GUI has been built using wxpython, Reportlab for reporting, SQLite for data storage
and matplot for input graphics.  The writer does not profess to be a computer programming
of any great skill, but has endevored to use best practices.
