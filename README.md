# PipeLoss

## Bases
This program is a GUI interface for the analyaia of pipe networks based on the documentation by Roland W. Jeppson:
January 1974
### Steady Flow Analysis of Pipe Networks: An Instructional Manual

and the follow up book;

### Hydraulics of Pipeline Systems
by;
Bruce E. Larock
Roland W. Jeppson
Gary Z. Watters

The original FORTRAN program has been reprinted and marked up to show how it was converted to this python 3.8 program.
See pdf file Main_FORTRAN_Prog

## Scope
This program should be able to handle most pipe networks or simple pipe lines.  Unlike the original FORTRAN program, 
this program allows for the selection of various fittings or valves.  The equivalent lengths of which are based on 
the values given in Crane Tech Paper 410-C

## Useage
To best understand the complexity of this program please review the Pipe_Loss_Manual.pdf
